# What is logo-place

Logo place is a quick utility meant to be used by HV for quick post processing, pasting logos and watermarks on tons of images to then send out on channels like telegram and so on

It takes images fomr input and writes them in output with identical names
It is indeed meant to be used to "brandify" the the pictures taken at an event

> This is part of HV internal tooling, so it won't come with extensive documentation unless you're part of the team
